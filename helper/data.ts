export const caseData="The case of Prabha Tyagi vs. Kamlesh Devi, heard by the Supreme Court of India, centers on the interpretation of provisions in the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (D.V. Act), particularly with regard to the appellant’s rights to her deceased husband’s property and protection from domestic violence. The appellant, Prabha Tyagi, filed a complaint against her mother-in-law, Kamlesh Devi, and other family members, alleging mental abuse and denial of her Stridhana after the death of her husband. The appeal came before the Supreme Court following decisions by the High Court of Uttarakhand and a lower appellate court, which had ruled against the appellant.\n\nBackground and Key Facts\n1. Marriage and Husband’s Death: The appellant, Prabha Tyagi, married Kuldeep Tyagi in June 2005. Shortly after the marriage, Kuldeep Tyagi died in a car accident in July 2005, leaving the appellant pregnant with their child. Following his death, the appellant moved to her parental home and later gave birth to a daughter in March 2006. She claimed that after her husband’s death, she was subjected to mental harassment by her in-laws, particularly her mother-in-law, who denied her access to her Stridhana and property rights.\n\n2. Stridhana and Property Disputes: The appellant alleged that her Stridhana (gifts and personal property given at marriage) was unlawfully retained by her in-laws, who continued to use these items even after she left the matrimonial home. She also claimed her right to her deceased husband’s property, which her in-laws contested. The mother-in-law, Kamlesh Devi, opposed the appellant’s inclusion in the revenue records as the legal heir to her husband’s property and disputed the paternity of her child.\n\n3. Initial Legal Proceedings: In response to these issues, Prabha Tyagi filed an application under Section 12 of the D.V. Act, seeking relief in the form of protection orders, compensation, and recognition of her right to reside in her husband’s property. The trial court ruled partially in her favor, awarding her compensation for mental harassment and ordering the return of her Stridhana. The trial court also recognized her right to her husband’s property and directed that she not be obstructed in enjoying her share.\n\n4. Appeal to Lower Courts: Kamlesh Devi, the mother-in-law, challenged the trial court’s decision in the appellate court, arguing that Prabha Tyagi had not lived in a shared household with her in-laws and was not entitled to relief under the D.V. Act. The appellate court agreed, concluding that since the appellant had not resided with her in-laws in the ancestral home after her husband’s death, she could not claim the protection of the D.V. Act. The court also held that there was no evidence that the appellant’s Stridhana was in the possession of the respondents. The High Court of Uttarakhand upheld this decision, leading to the appeal before the Supreme Court.\n\nIssues for Consideration\nThe primary legal issues before the Supreme Court were:\n\n1. Interpretation of “Shared Household”: One of the key points of contention was whether the appellant had resided in a \"shared household\" as required under the D.V. Act. The D.V. Act defines a shared household as one where the aggrieved person lives or has lived at any point of time with the respondent. The question was whether Prabha Tyagi’s temporary residence with her in-laws, before moving to her parental home after her husband’s death, qualified as living in a shared household.\n\n2. Necessity of Domestic Incident Report (DIR): Another significant issue was whether the absence of a Domestic Incident Report (DIR) rendered the trial court’s order invalid. Under Section 12(1) of the D.V. Act, a DIR is required when a Protection Officer files a complaint, but the appellant argued that when a complaint is directly filed by the aggrieved person, no such report is mandatory.\n\n3. Right to Reside in Husband’s Property: The case also raised the issue of whether the appellant retained her right to reside in her deceased husband’s property, despite the opposition of her mother-in-law and the fact that her husband had died shortly after their marriage.\n\nSupreme Court’s Analysis\nThe Supreme Court thoroughly examined the provisions of the D.V. Act, particularly the definitions of “shared household” and “domestic relationship,” as well as the legislative intent behind the Act’s broad protection for women.\n\n1. Shared Household and Domestic Relationship: The Court held that the appellant’s brief residence with her in-laws following her husband’s death was sufficient to establish the existence of a shared household under the D.V. Act. The Act defines a domestic relationship as one where two persons live or have lived together in a shared household at any point of time. The Court emphasized that the length of time spent in the shared household should not disqualify an aggrieved person from seeking relief. Even if the appellant had only stayed in her in-laws’ house for a short period, she had a domestic relationship with them by virtue of her marriage, and this relationship continued after her husband’s death.\n\n2. Domestic Incident Report (DIR) Not Mandatory: The Court clarified that the D.V. Act does not mandate the submission of a DIR in cases where the complaint is directly filed by the aggrieved person. A DIR is only necessary when the complaint is made through a Protection Officer. In the absence of such a report, the Magistrate still has the authority to take cognizance of the case and grant relief based on the evidence provided.\n\n3. Right to Reside in the Shared Household: The Court reinforced the right of every woman in a domestic relationship to reside in the shared household, regardless of whether she has any legal or financial stake in the property. The D.V. Act aims to protect women from being evicted from their homes, particularly in situations where they are vulnerable after the death of a spouse. The Court ruled that the appellant had the right to reside in her husband’s property, as the shared household concept under the D.V. Act includes property owned by the husband’s family.\n\nConclusion\nThe Supreme Court overturned the judgments of the lower appellate court and the High Court, reinstating the trial court’s decision in favor of the appellant. The Court’s ruling highlighted the expansive interpretation of the D.V. Act, emphasizing that its provisions are intended to protect women from domestic violence and ensure their right to a safe residence, even after the death of a spouse.\n\nThe judgment is significant because it reaffirms that the D.V. Act should be interpreted in a manner that extends its protective umbrella to women in a wide range of domestic relationships. The Court underscored that a woman’s right to reside in a shared household should not be undermined by technicalities such as the duration of residence or the lack of a Domestic Incident Report. This case serves as an important precedent for future cases involving claims under the D.V. Act, reinforcing the broad remedial scope of the law to protect women from domestic violence and secure their rights to a safe home."
